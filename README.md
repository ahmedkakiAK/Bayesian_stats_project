# Bayesian Statistical Analysis: Exploring Diabetes and Energy Consumption Data  

## Overview  
This project applies Bayesian methods to analyze two datasets: the **National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseasesâ€™ (NIDDK) diabetes dataset** and the **PJM Interconnectionâ€™s hourly energy consumption dataset**. Inspired by the 2017 paper *"Deep Learning: A Bayesian Perspective"*, we implement Bayesian approaches to showcase their strengths, challenges, and the potential for broader applications in statistical analysis. We also explore advancements in Bayesian methodologies since the paperâ€™s publication.
